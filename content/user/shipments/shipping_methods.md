## Shipping Methods

Shipping methods are the services used to send the product. For example:

* UPS Ground
* UPS One Day
* FedEx 2Day
* FedEx Overnight
* DHL International

Each shipping method is only applicable to a specific Zone. For example, you wouldn’t be able to get a package delivered internationally using a domestic-only shipping method. You can’t ship from Dallas, USA to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil using UPS Ground (a US-only carrier).
